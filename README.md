*Extension Source Path*
============

An extension to point to the source location of Google Chrome extensions.

Would you like to see how popular extensions have implemented a feature? Tired of looking for the extension ID to construct the path that will lead you to the source?
This is the extension for you!

This is a fork with major change of https://github.com/shaihi/ext-src-path: The original extension was hijacking you newtab page to show you
the main gui where you can see all your extension, it was very inconvenient.

So now to display the interface you just have to click on the new icon in the Chrome toolbar, also some minor tweak have been made to the CSS.


*Features:*
Lists all installed extensions with their icons next to it
Allows to copy to the clipboard the extension path

Note: Extension that are loaded unpacked are are marked as "Extension under development"
